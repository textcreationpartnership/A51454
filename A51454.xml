            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Againſt the Sarajens full rude,</l>

            <l>VVhere many a Gyant he ſubdu'd,</l>

            <l>within that Country there did reſt</l>
            <l>A dreadful Dragon fierce and fell,</l>
            <l>whereby they were full fore oppreſt:</l>

            <l>Did many of the City ſlay</l>

            <l>That they their wiſe men did intreat,</l>

            <l>Thé wiſe men all before the King,</l>

            <l>His Skin more hard then braſs was found</l>
            <l>That ſword or ſpear could pierce or wound.</l>
            <l>VVhen this the people underſtood,</l>
            <l>they cryed out moſt piteouſly,</l>
            <l>The Dragons breath infected their blood,</l>
            <l>that they each day in heaps did dye,</l>
            <l>Amongſt them ſuch a plague it bred</l>
            <l>The living ſcarce could bury the dead.</l>
            <l>No means there was that they could find,</l>
            <l>for to appeaſe the Dragons rage,</l>
            <l>But by a Virgin pure and kind,</l>
            <l>whereby he might his fury ſwage:</l>
            <l>Each day he ſhould a Maiden eat,</l>
            <l>For to allay his hunger great.</l>
            <l>This thing by art the wiſe men found,</l>

            <l>VVherefore throughout the City round,</l>
            <l>a Virgin pure of good degrees</l>
            <l>VVas by the Kings Commiſſion ſtill,</l>
            <l>Took up to ſerve the Dragons will.</l>
            <l>Thus did the Dragon every day,</l>
            <l>a Maiden of the Town devour,</l>
            <l>Till all the Maids were worn away,</l>
            <l>and none were left that preſent hour,</l>
            <l>Saving the Kings fair daughter bright,</l>
            <l>Her Fathers joy and hearts delight.</l>
            <l>Then came the Officers to the King,</l>
            <l>this heavy meſſage to declare</l>
            <l>VVhich did his heart with ſorrow ſting,</l>
            <l>ſhe is (quoth he) my Kingdoms heir:</l>
            <l>O let us all be poyſoned here,</l>
            <l>E're ſhe ſhould dye that is my dear.</l>
            <l>Then roſe the people preſently,</l>
            <l>and to the King in rage they went,</l>
            <l>VVho ſaid his daughter dear ſhould dye,</l>
            <l>the Dragons fury to prevent;</l>
            <l>Our daughters all are dead quoth they,</l>
            <l>And have been made the Dragons prey.</l>
            <l>And by their blood thou haſt been bleſt,</l>
            <l>and thou haſt ſav'd thy life thereby,</l>
            <l>And now in Iuſtice it doth reſt,</l>
            <l>for us thy daughter ſo ſhould dye:</l>
            <l>O ſave my daughter ſaid the King,</l>
            <l>And let me feel the Dragons ſting.</l>
            <l>Then fell fair <hi>Sabrine</hi> on her knee,</l>
            <l>and to her father thus did ſay</l>
            <l>O Father ſtrive not thus for me,</l>
            <l>but let me be the Dragons prey,</l>
            <l>It may be too my ſake alone,</l>
            <l>This Plague upon the Land was ſhown</l>
            <l>'Tis better I ſhould dye (ſhe ſaid)</l>
            <l>then all your Subjects periſh quite,</l>
            <l>Perhaps the Dragon here was laid,</l>
            <l>for my offence to work his ſpight:</l>
            <l>And after he hath ſuckt my Gore,</l>
            <l>Your Land ſhall feel the grief no more.</l>
            <l>What haſt thou done my daughter dear,</l>
            <l>for to deſerve this heavy ſcourge,</l>
            <l>It is my fault it ſhall appear.</l>
            <l>which makes the Gods our ſtate to grudge</l>
            <l>Then ought I dye to ſtint the ſtrife,</l>
            <l>And to preſerve thy happy life.</l>
            <l>Like mad-men all the people cry'd</l>
            <l>thy death to us can do no good,</l>
            <l>Our ſafety only doth abide,</l>
            <l>to make thy daughter Dragons food:</l>
            <l>Loe here I am, (O then quoth ſhe,)</l>
            <l>Therefore do what you will with me.</l>
            <l>Nay ſtay dear daughter (qd. the Queen)</l>
            <l>and as thou art a Virgin bright,</l>
            <l>That hath for vertue famous been,</l>
            <l>ſo let me cloath thee all in white</l>
            <l>And crown thy head with flowers ſweet,</l>
            <l>An ornament for Virgins meet.</l>
            <l>And when ſhe was attired ſo,</l>
            <l>according to her mothers mind;</l>
            <l>Vnto the ſtake then ſhe did go,</l>
            <l>to which they did this Virgin bind,</l>
            <l>And being bound to ſtake and thrall,</l>
            <l>She bad farewell unto them all.</l>
            <l>Farewel dear Father then (quoth ſhe)</l>
            <l>and my ſweet mother meek and mild,</l>
            <l>Take you no thought nor care for me</l>

            <l>The King and Queen with all their train</l>
            <l>with weeping eyes then went their way</l>
            <l>And let their daughter there remain,</l>
            <l>to be the hungry Dragons prey;</l>
            <l>But as ſhe there did weeping lye,</l>
            <l>Behold St. <hi>George</hi> came riding by,</l>
            <l>Now like unto a valiant knight,</l>
            <l>ſtraight unto her did take his way</l>
            <l>And being amazed at this ſight,</l>
            <l>He then to her theſe words did ſay,</l>

            <l>That ſoon will make an end of me.</l>
            <l>St. <hi>George</hi> then looking round about,</l>
            <l>the fiery Dragon ſoon eſpy'd,</l>
            <l>And like a Knight of couragé ſtout,</l>
            <l>againſt him he did fiercely ridé:</l>
            <l>And with ſuch blows he did him greet;</l>

               <l>And brought the Lady to the Court,</l>

               <l>He in the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Court then ſtaid,</l>
               <l>Till he moſt falſely was betray'd.</l>
               <l>The Lady <hi>Sabrine</hi> lov'd him well,</l>
               <l>he counted her his only joy,</l>
               <l>But when their love was open known,</l>
               <l>it prov'd St. Georges great annoy:</l>
               <l>The <hi>Morocco</hi> King was in the Court,</l>
               <l>VVho to the Orchard did reſort,</l>
               <l>Daily to take the pleaſant ayr,</l>
               <l>for pleaſures ſake he us'd to walk,</l>
               <l>Under a wall, whereas he heard,</l>
               <l>St. <hi>George</hi> with Lady <hi>Sabrine</hi> talk;</l>
               <l>Their loves he revealed to the King,</l>
               <l>VVhich to St. <hi>George</hi> great woe did bring.</l>
               <l>Theſé Kings together did deviſe,</l>
               <l>to make this Chriſtian Knight away,</l>
               <l>VVith Letters him Ambaſſador,</l>
               <l>they ſtraightway ſent to <hi>Perſia</hi>:</l>
               <l>And wrote to'th <hi>Sophy</hi> him to kill,</l>
               <l>And treacherouſly his blood to ſpill.</l>
               <l>Thus they for good did him reward,</l>
               <l>with Evil and moſt ſubtilly;</l>
               <l>By ſuch vile means they did deviſe,</l>
               <l>to work his death moſt cruelly:</l>
               <l>VVhile he in <hi>Perſia</hi> abode,</l>
               <l>He ſtraight deſtroy'd each Idol God.</l>
               <l>VVhich being done he ſtraight was caſt</l>
               <l>into a Dungeon dark and deep,</l>
               <l>But when he thought upon his wrong,</l>
               <l>he bitterly did wail and weep,</l>
               <l>Yet like a Knight of courage ſtout,</l>
               <l>Forth of the Dungeon he got out.</l>
               <l>And in the night three horſe-keepers,</l>
               <l>this valiant Knight by power ſlew,</l>
               <l>Although he faſted many a day,</l>
               <l>and then away from thence he flew,</l>
               <l>On the beſt Steed that <hi>Sophy</hi> had,</l>
               <l>VVhich when he knew he was full ſad.</l>
               <l>Then into Chriſtendom he came,</l>
               <l>and met a Gyant by the way,</l>
               <l>VVith him in combate he did Fight,</l>
               <l>moſt valiantly a ſummers day,</l>
               <l>VVho yet for all his bats of Steel,</l>
               <l>VVas forc'd the ſting of death to feel.</l>
               <l>From Chriſtendom that valiant Knight,</l>
               <l>then with VVarlike Souldiers paſt,</l>
               <l>Vowing upon that Heathen Land,</l>
               <l>to work revenge, which at the laſt</l>
               <l>E're thrice three years were gone &amp; ſpent,</l>
               <l>He did unto his great content,</l>
               <l>Save only <hi>AEgypt</hi> Land he ſpar'd,</l>
               <l>for <hi>Sabrine</hi> bright her only ſake;</l>
               <l>And e're his rage he did ſurpaſs,</l>
               <l>he meant a tryal kind to make,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ptolomy</hi> did know his ſtrength in field,</l>
               <l>And unto him did kindly yield.</l>
               <l>Then he the <hi>Morocco</hi> king did kill,</l>
               <l>and took fair <hi>Sabrine</hi> to his wife;</l>
               <l>And afterwards contentedly,</l>
               <l>with her St. <hi>George</hi> did lead his life,</l>
               <l>VVho by the vertue of a chain,</l>
               <l>Did ſtill a virgin pure remain.</l>
               <l>To <hi>England</hi> then St. <hi>George</hi> did bring,</l>
               <l>this gallant Lady <hi>Sabrine</hi> bright,</l>
               <l>An Eunuch alſo came with them,</l>
               <l>in whom the Lady did delight:</l>
               <l>None but theſe three from <hi>AEgypt</hi> came,</l>
               <l>Now let me print St. <hi>Georges</hi> fame.</l>
               <l>VVhen they were in the forreſt great,</l>
               <l>the Lady did deſire to reſt,</l>
               <l>And then St. <hi>George</hi> to kill a Deer.</l>
               <l>to feed thereon did think it beſt,</l>
               <l>Left <hi>Sabrine</hi> and the Eunuch there,</l>
               <l>VVhile he did go and kill a Deer</l>
               <l>The mean time in his abſence came,</l>
               <l>two hungry Lyons fierce and fell,</l>
               <l>And tore the Eunuch preſently,</l>
               <l>in pieces ſmall the truth to tell,</l>
               <l>Down by the Lady then they laid,</l>
               <l>VVhereby it ſeem'd ſhe was a Maid,</l>
               <l>But when St. <hi>George</hi> from hunting came</l>
               <l>and did behold this heavy chance,</l>
               <l>Yet for his lovely Virgin pure,</l>
               <l>his courage ſtout he did advance:</l>
               <l>And came within the Lyons ſight.</l>
               <l>VVho run at him withal their might,</l>
               <l>But he being not a bit diſmaid,</l>
               <l>but like a ſtout and valiant Knight,</l>
               <l>Did kill the hungry Lyons both,</l>
               <l>within the Lady <hi>Sabrines</hi> ſight,</l>
               <l>But all this while ſad and damure,</l>
               <l>She ſtood there like a Virgin pure.</l>
               <l>Then when St. <hi>George</hi> did truly know,</l>
               <l>his Lady was a Virgin true,</l>
               <l>Thoſe doleful thoughts that e'te was dumb,</l>
               <l>began moſt firmly to renew,</l>
